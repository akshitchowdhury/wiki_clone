                        Naruto is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Masashi Kishimoto. It tells the
                        story of Naruto

                        of his
                        village. The story
                        is told in two parts – the first set in Naruto's pre-teen years, and the second in his teens.

                    Naruto is one of the best-selling manga series in history having 250 million copies in
                    circulation worldwide in 47 countries and regions, with 153 million copies in Japan alone
                    and remaining 97 million copies elsewhere. It has become one of Viz Media's best-selling
                    manga series; their English translations of the volumes have appeared on USA Today and The
                    New York Times bestseller list several times, and the seventh volume won a Quill Award in
                    2006. Reviewers praised the manga's character development, strong storylines, and
                    well-executed fight scenes, though some felt the fight scenes slowed the story down. Critics
                    noted that the manga, which has a coming-of-age theme, makes use of cultural references from
                    Japanese mythology and Confucianism.

    <h2><b>Plot</b></h2>
    <hr>
    <h3><b>Part 1</b></h3>
    <div id="plot1" style="font-size: large; text-align: justify;">
        <p>
            A powerful fox known as the Nine-Tails attacks Konoha, the hidden leaf village in the Land of Fire, one
            of
            the
            Five Great Shinobi Countries in the Ninja World. In response, the leader of Konoha and the Fourth
            Hokage,
            Minato
            Namikaze seals the fox inside the body of his newborn son, Naruto Uzumaki, making Naruto a host of the
            beast;[i]
            this costs Naruto's father his life, and the Third Hokage returns from retirement to become the leader
            of
            Konoha
            again. Naruto is often scorned by Konoha's villagers for being the host of the Nine-Tails. Due to a
            decree
            by
            the Third Hokage forbidding any mention of these events, Naruto learns nothing about the Nine-Tails
            until 12
            years later, when Mizuki, a renegade ninja, reveals the truth to Naruto. Naruto then defeats Mizuki in
            combat,
            earning the respect of his teacher, Iruka Umino. </p>

        <p>

            Shortly afterward, Naruto becomes a ninja and joins with Sasuke Uchiha, against whom he often competes,
            and
            Sakura Haruno, on whom he has a crush, to form Team 7, under an experienced sensei, the elite ninja
            Kakashi
            Hatake. Like all the ninja teams from every village, Team 7 completes missions requested by the
            villagers,
            ranging from doing chores and being bodyguards to performing assassinations. </p>

        <p>

            After several missions, including a major one in the Land of Waves, Kakashi allows Team 7 to take a
            ninja
            exam,
            enabling them to advance to a higher rank and take on more difficult missions, known as Chunin Exams.
            During
            the
            exams, Orochimaru, a wanted criminal, invades Konoha and kills the Third Hokage for revenge. Jiraiya,
            one of
            the
            three legendary ninjas, declines the title of Fifth Hokage and searches with Naruto for Tsunade whom he
            chooses
            to become Fifth Hokage instead. </p>

        <p>

            During the search, it is revealed that Orochimaru wishes to train Sasuke because of his powerful genetic
            heritage, the Sharingan.[iii] After Sasuke attempts and fails to kill his older brother Itachi,[iv] who
            had
            showed up in Konoha to kidnap Naruto, he joins Orochimaru, hoping to gain from him the strength needed
            to
            kill
            Itachi. The story takes a turn when Sasuke leaves the village: Tsunade sends a group of ninja, including
            Naruto,
            to retrieve Sasuke, but Naruto is unable to persuade or force him to come back. Naruto and Sakura do not
            give up
            on Sasuke; Naruto leaves Konoha to receive training from Jiraiya to prepare himself for the next time he
            encounters Sasuke, while Sakura becomes Tsunade's apprentice.

    <h3><b>Part 2</b></h3>
    <div id="plot2" style="font-size: large; text-align: justify;">
        <p>
            Two and a half years later, Naruto returns from his training with Jiraiya. The Akatsuki starts kidnapping
            the hosts of the powerful Tailed Beasts. Team 7 and other Leaf ninja fight against them and search for their
            teammate Sasuke. The Akatsuki succeeds in capturing and extracting seven of the Tailed Beasts, killing all
            the hosts except Gaara, who is now the Kazekage. Meanwhile, Sasuke betrays Orochimaru and faces Itachi to
            take revenge. After Itachi dies in battle, Sasuke learns from the Akatsuki founder Tobi that Itachi had been
            ordered by Konoha's superiors to destroy his clan to prevent a coup; he accepted, on the condition that
            Sasuke would be spared. Devastated by this revelation, Sasuke joins the Akatsuki to destroy Konoha in
            revenge. As Konoha ninjas defeat several Akatsuki members, the Akatsuki figurehead leader, Nagato, kills
            Jiraiya and devastates Konoha, but Naruto defeats and redeems him, earning the village's respect and
            admiration.

        </p>
        <p>

            With Nagato's death, Tobi, disguised as Madara Uchiha (one of Konoha's founding fathers), announces that he
            wants to capture all nine Tailed Beasts to cast an illusion powerful enough to control all humanity and
            achieve world peace. The leaders of the five ninja villages refuse to help him and instead join forces to
            confront his faction and allies. That decision results in a Fourth Shinobi World War between the combined
            armies of the Five Great Countries (known as the Allied Shinobi Forces) and Akatsuki's forces of zombie-like
            ninjas. The Five Kage try to keep Naruto, unaware of the war, in a secret island turtle near Kumogakure
            (Hidden Cloud Village), but Naruto finds out and escapes from the island with Killer Bee, the host of the
            Eight-Tails. At that time, Naruto—along with the help of Killer Bee—gains control of his Tailed Beast and
            the two of them head for the battlefield.
        </p>
        <p>

            During the conflict, it is revealed that Tobi is Obito Uchiha and not Madara as he claimed. Obito is a
            former teammate of Kakashi's who was thought to be dead. The real Madara saved Obito's life, and they have
            since collaborated. As Sasuke learns the history of Konoha, including the circumstances that led to his
            clan's downfall, he decides to protect the village and rejoins Naruto and Sakura to thwart Madara and
            Obito's plans. However, Madara's body ends up possessed by Kaguya Otsutsuki, an ancient princess who intends
            to subdue all humanity. A reformed Obito sacrifices himself to help Team 7 stop her. Once Kaguya is sealed,
            Madara dies as well. Sasuke takes advantage of the situation and takes control of all the Tailed Beasts, as
            he reveals his goal of ending the current village system. Naruto confronts Sasuke to dissuade him from his
            plan, and after they almost kill each other in a final battle, Sasuke admits defeat and reforms. After the
            war, Kakashi becomes the Sixth Hokage and pardons Sasuke for his crimes. Years later, Kakashi steps down
            while Naruto marries Hinata Hyuga and becomes the Seventh Hokage, raising the next generation.
