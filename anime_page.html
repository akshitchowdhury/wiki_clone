            Naruto is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Masashi Kishimoto. It tells the story of Naruto
            Uzumaki, a
            young ninja who seeks recognition from his peers and dreams of becoming the Hokage, the leader of his
            village. The story
            is told in two parts – the first set in Naruto's pre-teen years, and the second in his teens. The series is
            based on two
            one-shot manga by Kishimoto: Karakuri (1995), which earned Kishimoto an honorable mention in Shueisha's
            monthly Hop Step
            Award the following year, and Naruto (1997).

    <h2><b>Plot</b></h2>
    <hr>
    <h3><b>Part 1</b></h3>
    <div class="plot1" style="font-size: large; text-align: justify;">
    <p>
        A powerful fox known as the Nine-Tails attacks Konoha, the hidden leaf village in the Land of Fire, one of the
        Five Great Shinobi Countries in the Ninja World. In response, the leader of Konoha and the Fourth Hokage, Minato
        Namikaze seals the fox inside the body of his newborn son, Naruto Uzumaki, making Naruto a host of the beast;[i]
        this costs Naruto's father his life, and the Third Hokage returns from retirement to become the leader of Konoha
        again. Naruto is often scorned by Konoha's villagers for being the host of the Nine-Tails. Due to a decree by
        the Third Hokage forbidding any mention of these events, Naruto learns nothing about the Nine-Tails until 12
        years later, when Mizuki, a renegade ninja, reveals the truth to Naruto. Naruto then defeats Mizuki in combat,
        earning the respect of his teacher, Iruka Umino. </p>

        <p>

        Shortly afterward, Naruto becomes a ninja and joins with Sasuke Uchiha, against whom he often competes, and
        Sakura Haruno, on whom he has a crush, to form Team 7, under an experienced sensei, the elite ninja Kakashi
        Hatake. Like all the ninja teams from every village, Team 7 completes missions requested by the villagers,
        ranging from doing chores and being bodyguards to performing assassinations. </p>

        <p>

        After several missions, including a major one in the Land of Waves, Kakashi allows Team 7 to take a ninja exam,
        enabling them to advance to a higher rank and take on more difficult missions, known as Chunin Exams. During the
        exams, Orochimaru, a wanted criminal, invades Konoha and kills the Third Hokage for revenge. Jiraiya, one of the
        three legendary ninjas, declines the title of Fifth Hokage and searches with Naruto for Tsunade whom he chooses
        to become Fifth Hokage instead. </p>

        <p>

        During the search, it is revealed that Orochimaru wishes to train Sasuke because of his powerful genetic
        heritage, the Sharingan.[iii] After Sasuke attempts and fails to kill his older brother Itachi,[iv] who had
        showed up in Konoha to kidnap Naruto, he joins Orochimaru, hoping to gain from him the strength needed to kill
        Itachi. The story takes a turn when Sasuke leaves the village: Tsunade sends a group of ninja, including Naruto,
        to retrieve Sasuke, but Naruto is unable to persuade or force him to come back. Naruto and Sakura do not give up
        on Sasuke; Naruto leaves Konoha to receive training from Jiraiya to prepare himself for the next time he
        encounters Sasuke, while Sakura becomes Tsunade's apprentice.
